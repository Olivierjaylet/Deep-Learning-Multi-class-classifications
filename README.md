# Single layer Neural Network -- Multi-class classification
## Predict class of Iris plant using Neural Networks

This project is an assignment made in the context of my Master studies

### Technologies

* Python
* Pytorch
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Google colab

### Dataset

Irisdata.sec (csv tab)
3 classes of 50 instances each, where each refers to a type of iris plant

### Method used 

* Logisic regression for Multiclass Classification
* Softmax regression with :
      - Cross entropy loss
      - Negative log likelihood loss
      - Mean squared error loss
* Linear regression with Mean squared error loss
